Want to create a stylized water shader with @unity3d shadergraph? Here's
how you can! #unitytips #madewithunity Full explanation here: https://alexanderameye.github.io/

First, let's figure out the depth of our water. 
We can do this by subtracting the alpha component of the screen position
from the scene depth. We also multiply by a depth range property from some more control and clamp the result.

Next, we use our clamped depth and use it to lerp between a shallow and deep water color. We also
use the clamped depth and plug it into the alpha slot of our material.

Let's add foam lines! What we do is define a foam size variable and use it to add a foam line to the lerped
color output. We clamp the result and put it in the albedo slot of our material.

Finally we add some waves by offsetting the y position of the vertices in our water plane. I did this with
a simple sine wave but of course you can go more complex for better results!
