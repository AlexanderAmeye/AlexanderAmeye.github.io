I'm a 19 year old engineering student from Belgium that loves to fill his spare time creating editor extensions and tools for Unity! I publish on the asset store as a hobby. I started playing around with html and Java when I was 15, but then quickly discovered Unity and switched over to learning C#. In 2015 I decided that I wanted to create assets for the store and I published my first one in August of that year. I create easy to use tools with a high attention to detail designed to boost your productivity. When you purchase one of my tools, you are guaranteed future updates and fast, extensive support on a personal level. Alex's Door System Lite is the first asset I've created. It's an easy-to-use door tool that works right out of the box. It has all the basic functionality you need to get working doors in your scene. The tool is really meant for Unity beginners. The source code is well documented, the UI is extremely straight-forward and the required setup is minimal. Alex's Door System is a more advanced version of the initial door script I created. It allows for greater control over your doors using trigger zones that check for certain conditions before moving the door. The system uses a physics based approach that allows for realistic door movement without the need for animations. The system is extremely flexible and easy to work with. RockStudio is a powerful tool that procedurally generates rocks in a low-poly style. The UI is built around productivity and a fluent workflow and the tool functions as a studio to create stunning rocks for your low-poly environment. There are still lots of exciting features to come to RockStudio and I'm excited to see what it will become!
