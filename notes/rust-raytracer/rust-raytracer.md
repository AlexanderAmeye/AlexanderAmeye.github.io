## Introduction
Last year I had an introduction course on computer graphics at my University. The course covered theory around raytracing and so I wanted to convert this theory into practice and write a path tracer. At the same time I wanted to learn Rust so decided to combine the two in one project.

## Setup

## Parallelisation with Rayon

## Anti-Aliasing

## Shoulders of Giants
