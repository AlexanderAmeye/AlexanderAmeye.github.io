## Introduction
In the late summer of 2019, I started looking into replicating a hand-drawn style within Unity. Specifically I wanted to successfully recreate the Ligne Claire style. The scene below was the first result in that attempt. It is a recreation of the panel from the right. This panel comes out The Black Island from The Adventures of Tintin created by Hergé.

A series of creations based on the work of Hergé in 'The Adventures Of Tintin'. The goal is to achieve a similar visual style within unity.
