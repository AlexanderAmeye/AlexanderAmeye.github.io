## Introduction

Since the introduction of Unity's <mark class="green">Scriptable Render Pipeline in 2018, you can create your own custom render passes and inject them into the render pipeline. Since the documentation on them is still lacking</mark>, I created this basic <mark class="orange">template pass that could function as some boilerplate code for your own passes. The code is heavily commented for those who want additional information about what's going on.

</video>

<mark class="blue">The pass simply blurs the screen using a 2-pass box blur shader. You can control the blur strength and set the downsampling factor. The code is tested to work with URP 10.3 in Unity 2020.3 LTS.</mark>

## Usage
<mark class="red">To use this custom pass, simply add it as a renderer feature in your Forward Renderer Data asset.</mark>
