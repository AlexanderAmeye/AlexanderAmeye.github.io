baking
https://github.com/maxartz15/VertexAnimation/tree/master/Runtime/Scripts
https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Mesh-Animation -> this seems better one to look at
it plays the animation and bakes it!

this one as well
https://github.com/chenjd/Render-Crowd-Of-Animated-Characters/blob/master/Assets/AnimMapBaker/Script/AnimMapBaker.cs (seems simple)


or this one
https://github.com/sugi-cho/Animation-Texture-Baker/blob/master/Readme.md (seems complex project)


## Storing Animations
### Vertex Animation Texture

### Generating the VAT

## Playing Animations

## Instancing

## Compute Shader
is this even useful?
