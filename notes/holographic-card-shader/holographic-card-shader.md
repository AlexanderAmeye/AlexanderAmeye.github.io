## Introduction

A short breakdown of how I made a <mark>holographic card shader</mark>. The goal was to do as much as possible in the shader itself without relying on any textures. I ended up using a single 3D model for the Pok√©mon and a single texture for the text. The design of the card was inspired by [Rob Fichman][rob-fichman]'s work. The 3D model of the Cosmog Pok√©mon was created by [AlmondFeather][almondfeather] on Sketchfab.

## Card Frame

The frame of the card consists of the outer edge, the horizontal divider at the bottom, the 'window' through where you see the Pok√©mon and the title bar below the window. 

All of these elements are drawn using simple <mark>rectangle and polygon shapes</mark>. I have full control over their dimensions which allows me to quickly change the structure and layout of the card. Here are some of the properties that I use to control the frame of the card.

In total, the shader has <mark>65 exposed properties</mark>. This is quite a lot, but I like that I can tweak variables as much as I want until I'm happy with the result. 

## Icons
The card features several icons like the ones used for indicating the type of the Pok√©mon. Additionally there are some decorational celestial bodies on the right bottom corner of the card. All of these are a made up of basic <mark>signed distance functions</mark>.

For the decorational corner pattern, the stars are made out of 2 vesica SDFs blended together. The moon is made out of 2 spheres and the planet is made out of several spheres and ellipses. All of the icons exist on the same plane, but I added a <mark>parallax effect</mark> to fake depth between the icons.

For practice, I recreated several of the pokemon-typ icons. It was very enjoyable to try and figure out what base shapes I could combine to end up with the right icon. If you want more information about drawing 2D SDFs you can check out this page from [Inigo Quilez][2d-sdf].

## Raymarched Spheres
There are little spheres in the card that I use for showing the pokemon types and the attacks. These are <mark>raymarched spheres</mark>. Together with some <mark>Blinn-Phong</mark> lighting they look 3D and I can fake having 3D objects in the shader without having any actual 3D geometry.

## Text
At first, I attempted to do the text in-shader as well. This is possible for sure, using <mark>bezier curves and SDFs</mark> and I actually got quite close to rendering letters how I wanted to.

{% noteimage "./notes/holographic-card-shader/text.png", "Text generation in shader.", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw", page.url %}

However in the end, it was quite a lot of work to render text with the exact font that I wanted, so I decided to just us a simple texture.

## Holographic Sparkles
For the sparkles I created some patterns using <mark>voronoi functions</mark>. Then, by converting the colors to directions and taking the dot product of this direction and the view direction, I could make different sparkles show up under different viewing angles.

{% noteimage "./notes/holographic-card-shader/voronoi2.png", "Voronoi pattern.", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw", page.url %}

Multiple voronoi patterns were overlayed on top of eachother to generate a more interesting pattern.

## Parallax Effect
The whole card is flat, but by using raymarched spheres and parallax effects, I managed to create a nice 3D effect. A parallax effect can be achieved by <mark>offsetting the UVs based on the view direction</mark>.

{% noteimage "./notes/holographic-card-shader/parallax-offset.png", "Parallax offset.", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw", page.url %}

Using parallax is great way to achieve some sense of depth in an otherwise flat card.

## Stencil Shader
A stencil shader was used to make it so that the 3D scene is only visible through the window of the card itself. [Cyanilux][stencil-explanation] has created a post that explains setting up stencils in URP.
