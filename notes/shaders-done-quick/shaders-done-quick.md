## Introduction
In the first few months of 2020 I created three <mark>60-second shader tutorials</mark>. These tutorials were meant to be quick, to-the-point and dense in information.

## Stylized Water Shader
A simple but effective water shader that creates an interesting stylized look. The shader uses the <mark>depth buffer</mark> for coloring and generating foam. Refraction is added by distorting the used UVs.

The model of the castle was created by [mStuff][mStuff] on Sketchfab.

## Toon Shading
A basic toon shader with a color gradient and hard specular lighting. A <mark>Blinn-Phong</mark> lighting model is used for the specular shading.

The model of the Shiba Inu was created by [Ida Fabere][Ida Fabere] on Sketchfab.

## Retro Effect
A retro pixelation effect that also includes some scanlines. A low resolution render texture is used for the pixelation and a <mark>full-screen shader</mark> is used for the post-processing effects.

The model of the subway was created by [Luc Miramont][Luc Miramont] on Sketchfab.
