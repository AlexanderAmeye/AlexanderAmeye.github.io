    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Back in the late summer of 2019, I started looking into replicating a hand-drawn style within Unity. Specifically
      I wanted to successfully recreate the <i>Ligne Claire</i> style. The scene below was the first result in that
      attempt. It is a recreation of the panel from the right. This panel comes out <i>The Black Island</i> from <i>The
        Adventures of Tintin</i> created by <i>Herg√©</i>.
    </p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <figure class="figure ">
        <img src="img/gifs/morningtraintolondon.gif" width="300" class="figure-img" alt="">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="figure ">
        <img src="img/shaders/hand-drawn/side.png" width="300" class="figure-img" alt="">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>While I am happy with how this scene turned out in the end, the workflow of creating it was slow and convoluted
      while
      having several artistical restrictions that required workarounds. Specifically the method of drawing outlines
      provided me with little to no
      artistic control over where outlines were drawn. The outline shader is good for drawing outlines on
      bigger geometry like the tunnel on the right, but when it comes to little details like the brick wall or the
      train, the shader was really hard to fine-tune.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Improved Rendering</h2>
      <p>At the end of March 2020, I revisited my rendering system and tried new approaches that would allow me to
        implement an improved workflow for creating scenes in a hand-drawn style. My new system had to provide me
        control over the following 2 important aspects of the linework.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Visuals (adjustable in-engine)</li>
        <li>Location (independent of how the object looks)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>My previous outline shader looked at discontinuities in color, depth or normals. This is easy to use, but
        provides me with little to none artistic control over the position of the outlines. I had to find another
        solution.</p>

      <p>My next idea was to draw the outlines on the texture of the object itself. While this method provides me
        control over the location of the outlines, it gives me no control over the visuals of the outlines inside of
        Unity. Once I painted the texture, the lines are there and if I want them to look different, I need to repaint
        them.</p>

        <p>My current approach is a hybrid of the 2 methods. Instead of creating a texture </p>
      <!--That's why I opted to create at least some of the linework in a
      texture. These lines could be directly painted onto the albedo texture, or a secondary texture could be made that
      contained <i>information</i> on where the outlines should be drawn. This information for example could be stored
      in the form of colored sections within the texture. Wherever there is a hard discontinuity, we can draw an
      outline.-->
    </p>
