Caustics:

have a caustic texture that you distort
apply on material using triplanar mapping
only gets drawn on objects that 'touch the water'
water touching is determined by world position (y=0) with an offset




Vertex Offset:

Gerstner Waves

vertices not only up and down but also left and right movement (real 3d waves)

important to recalculate normals




Color:

color gradient based on distance from camera. So not only color varation in depth but also in distance from player
or camera

you can make material unlit and fake the litness


add fresnel to depth fade to remove some artifact

use a scene color node and tint the water based on that scene color
use scene color node as base



Reflections:

fake texture on top


Refraction:

distance mask, only make refractions where the player is + fresnel
