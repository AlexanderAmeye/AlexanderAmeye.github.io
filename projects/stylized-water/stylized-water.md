## Introduction
During the few months between November 2019 and April 2020 I created a [stylized water shader][asset-link] for the Universal Render Pipeline and published it on the Unity Asset Store. The asset was received positively with <mark>94% five star reviews</mark> and the asset was even nominated for the best artistic tool in the [Unity Awards 2020][unity-awards].

## Features
The shader is packed with features such as <mark>refraction, caustics, gerstner waves, buoyancy and planar reflections</mark>. Visually, I managed to create very nice looking water that was easy to tweak due to the custom material editor I made for it.

{% projectimage "./notes/stylized-water/caustics.png", "Stylized water caustics.", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw", page.url %}

{% projectimage "./notes/stylized-water/reflections.png", "Stylized water reflections.", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw", page.url %}

## Usage in Games
I have spotted the asset being used in multiple games/projects that are in development. An example of this is the city builder/management game that is in development by [Max Nielsen][max-nielsen-twitter]. I actively asked the community to share their games that used the shader and I loved seeing the asset in action.
